1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a JavaScript library built by Facebook. React JS aims to create modular single page applications with a component based system. React focuses on the front end layer and the user interface and how it works using state.

1. Describe component state.

Component state is how each component hold and store data in it's state. It allows a re-render of the view without refreshing the page. This way data can be fetched and pushed to the user's interface without a refresh or going to another page.

1. Describe props.

Props are properties or state passed down from a parent to allow a child component to use it as well.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects are events that happen outside the current app, like fetching data and performing utilities in the background of the app.
